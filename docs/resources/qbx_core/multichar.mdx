### Can I use my own multicharacter?

Yes, you can. To disable the built in multicharacter change this setting to true in `qbx_core/config/client.lua`
```lua filename="qbx_core/config/client.lua"
 -- Whether you have an external character management resource. (If true, disables the character management inside the core)
useExternalCharacters = false,
```
