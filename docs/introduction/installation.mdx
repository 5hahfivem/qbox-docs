# Installation

:::info
We highly recommend using **txAdmin** to install your FiveM server.  
For detailed instructions, refer to [Setting up a server using txAdmin](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/server-manual/setting-up-a-server-txadmin/).
:::

## Installation Steps

### 1. Download the server

Download the latest [FiveM artifacts](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_server_windows/master/) and extract the files.

### 2. Start the server installation 

Run `FXServer.exe` to begin the installation and follow all the steps.

### 3. Deploy the recipe

When prompted, select `Remote URL Template`:

Use the raw recipe link shown below:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="unstable" label="Qbox Unstable" default>
    The Qbox Unstable Recipe comes with *all* of our actively maintained resources.
    Use this if you're looking for a complete server base.

    ```bash
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qbox-project/txAdminRecipe/main/qbox.yaml
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="lean" label="Qbox Lean">
    The Qbox Lean Recipe is a stripped down version of Qbox, without excess resources,
    and it does not include any criminal or civilian activities.
    Use this if you're looking for a smaller server base to build off of.

    ```bash
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qbox-project/txAdminRecipe/main/qbox-lean.yaml
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="stable" label="Qbox Stable">
    The Qbox Stable Recipe comes with the resources we consider stable, based on our Release Readiness guidelines.
    Use this if you're looking for the most stable experience.

    :::caution
    Since many Qbox resources are still a work-in-progress, some important resources are still considered unstable,
    and are currently missing from this recipe. This may result in various issues.
    You are expected to find alternatives by yourself, or to download the unstable versions of those resources.

    ```bash

    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 4. Run the server

Once you have completed all of the installation steps, run the server.
